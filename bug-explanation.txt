This branch is maded to fix an error ocurred on the research of regex.
Sometimes the object don't found the regex on the text, this is because
the regex on the method only have one option to search, this branch have
the porpouse of fix this issue.

Note: They are two options to fix it, the first one is use herency on the 
class to made a new object with the especific regex you want to use,this
must be the best option but, on a second hand, we can build exclusive regex
on the blueprint, but this must be the most general regex ass posible to 
preserve the posibility to use the blue print in mor than one log file.
